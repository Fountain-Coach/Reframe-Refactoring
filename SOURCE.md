# Source and Synchronization Contract

## Roles

This repository is the publication and FCIS-governance home of the Reframe Grounding-first refactoring guide.

The integration copy lives beside the application implementation at:

```text
Fountain-Coach/midi2-gpu-fabric
apps/modernization-studio/docs/reframe-grounding-first-refactor/
```

The publication copy lives here under `docs/`. Neither copy is permitted to drift silently. A guide change is maintained only when both repositories contain the same chapter set and content.

Changes may begin in either repository, but the pull request that publishes them must name the corresponding commit or pull request in the other repository. The documentation sync skill performs comparison and explicit transfer. Its default action is read-only comparison; transfer requires an explicit direction.

Runtime implementation, tests, generated reasoning manifests, and application-specific plans remain in `midi2-gpu-fabric`. This repository owns the refactoring guide and its FCIS governance, not the Reframe runtime.

- Release-surface chapter: `docs/43-the-released-surface-is-a-named-build.md`, synchronized with the integration guide and added 2026-08-03.
- Publication-boundary chapter: `docs/44-publication-and-source-policy.md`, synchronized with the integration guide;
  it governs the public Book projection, the private runtime boundary, and the org FCIS publication policy.
- Policy PRs: org FCIS `Fountain-Coach/.github#4`, governance `Fountain-Coach/Reframe-Refactoring#7`, runtime
  `Fountain-Coach/midi2-gpu-fabric#21`, and Book `Fountain-Coach/book-of-reframe#9`.
