# Source and Synchronization Contract

## Current synchronized change

- Change: Chapter 46 amendment, `the report says what it cannot tell, and ends in the writer's hands` — rules
  20–23 and their acceptance, added after calibrating the comparison rules 16–19 deliver: reading the same lines
  twice through the SAME lens gives 5 held / 19 dissolved / 23 opened against 1 / 23 / 27 for a real lens change,
  the same magnitude, with the control dissolving the very questions the changed-lens report had cited as its
  evidence. A comparison therefore states what it cannot tell, attributes nothing it cannot establish, treats
  "I cannot tell" as the third honest outcome, ends in the writer's action, and binds both `/readings` and the
  unasked report because they are two triggers over one comparison.

## Roles

This repository is the publication and FCIS-governance home of the Reframe Grounding-first refactoring guide.

The integration copy lives beside the application implementation at:

```text
Fountain-Coach/midi2-gpu-fabric
apps/modernization-studio/docs/reframe-grounding-first-refactor/
```

The publication copy lives here under `docs/`. Neither copy is permitted to drift silently. A guide change is maintained only when both repositories contain the same chapter set and content.

## Maintenance rule

## Previous synchronized changes

Newest first. Every entry below was `Current` when it was written; they are kept as the record of what
crossed between the repositories and under which commits and pull requests.

### 1.

- Change: Chapter 46 amendment, `a lens is a hypothesis about the reader, not a description of the work` — states
  that a first reading's residue has two origins (the work's and the reading's), that a lens names the reader's
  suspected blind spot rather than summarizing the open questions, and adds rules 11–15 (adoptable lens; the
  proposal cites the pattern as evidence; the writer's own lens is verbatim and authoritative; a lens is proved by
  a change in the kind of uncertainty across two readings; a hole is not a lens problem).

- Integration path: `apps/modernization-studio/docs/reframe-grounding-first-refactor/`
- Publication path: `docs/`
- Integration commits: `Fountain-Coach/midi2-gpu-fabric@169e1adf` (amendment),
  `Fountain-Coach/midi2-gpu-fabric@7db89198` (acceptance for rules 11–15 + reading-index entry)
- Integration pull request: `https://github.com/Fountain-Coach/midi2-gpu-fabric/pull/24`

### 2.

- Change: Chapter 45, `Copilot Reading Surface and Typography`
- Direction: integration → publication (manual exact transfer; the documented sync helper was absent in this checkout)
- Integration path: `apps/modernization-studio/docs/reframe-grounding-first-refactor/45-copilot-reading-surface-and-typography.md`
- Publication path: `docs/45-copilot-reading-surface-and-typography.md`
- Illustrations: `docs/illustrations/copilot-working-state.png`, `docs/illustrations/copilot-focused-state.png`
- Integration commit: `Fountain-Coach/midi2-gpu-fabric@74d84a75`
- Synchronized: 2026-08-03

Changes may begin in either repository, but the pull request that publishes them must name the corresponding commit or pull request in the other repository. The documentation sync skill performs comparison and explicit transfer. Its default action is read-only comparison; transfer requires an explicit direction.

Runtime implementation, tests, generated reasoning manifests, and application-specific plans remain in `midi2-gpu-fabric`. This repository owns the refactoring guide and its FCIS governance, not the Reframe runtime.

- Release-surface chapter: `docs/43-the-released-surface-is-a-named-build.md`, synchronized with the integration guide and added 2026-08-03.
- Publication-boundary chapter: `docs/44-publication-and-source-policy.md`, synchronized with the integration guide;
  it governs the public Book projection, the private runtime boundary, and the org FCIS publication policy.
- Policy PRs: org FCIS `Fountain-Coach/.github#4`, governance `Fountain-Coach/Reframe-Refactoring#7`, runtime
  `Fountain-Coach/midi2-gpu-fabric#21`, and Book `Fountain-Coach/book-of-reframe#9`.
