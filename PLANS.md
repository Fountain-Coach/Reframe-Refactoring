# PLANS.md

This file records intent for multi-step or high-risk changes to the Reframe refactoring guide. It is not a runbook. Procedures belong in `.codex/skills/`.

Title: Initial FCIS-compliant publication (2026-07-19)
Goal: Publish the complete Grounding-first Reframe refactoring guide in a dedicated Fountain Coach repository and establish reciprocal provenance with its integration copy.
Scope: guide chapters, repository landing page, source contract, FCIS layers, synchronization skill and script, validation, and GitHub publication.
Non-goals: implementing the Reframe runtime refactor, changing the MIDI backplane IDL, mutating FountainStore, or deleting legacy index artifacts.
Constraints: preserve exact guide content; keep AGENTS declarative, plans intentional, and procedures in skills; keep MCP optional; create no new dependency.
Risks: two copies can drift or claim conflicting authority; mitigate with explicit roles, exact provenance, a read-only default sync check, and counterpart links in every publication change.
Plan:
- Step 1 (status: done) - Import the committed integration guide into `docs/`.
- Step 2 (status: done) - Add FCIS-compliant repository layers and synchronization ownership.
- Step 3 (status: done) - Validate content parity, links, shell syntax, and repository hygiene.
- Step 4 (status: done) - Publish the private Fountain Coach repository and verify reciprocal links.
Validation:
- Every guide chapter exists under `docs/` and relative Markdown links resolve.
- `Scripts/sync-integration-copy --check <integration-checkout>` reports no difference.
- `sh -n Scripts/sync-integration-copy` passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.

Results:
- Published privately at `https://github.com/Fountain-Coach/Reframe-Refactoring` with `main` as the default branch.
- Recorded the integration source at `midi2-gpu-fabric` commit `da22ba0c54e0fff6fb44f66182cecab0dd18759e` and draft PR `#8`.
- Confirmed guide parity, relative links, synchronization-script syntax, and Git whitespace hygiene.
